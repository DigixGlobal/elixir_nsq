# elixir_nsq - UNDER CONSTRUCTION

The goal of this project is to create a production-ready Elixir client library
for NSQ. It is currently in a phase of rapid prototyping, and is _not ready_
for production yet. When that time comes, the readme will reflect it.

See these resources for more info on building client libraries:
